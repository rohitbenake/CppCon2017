# Make Classes Great Again (using Concepts for Customization Points)

This repository contains the presentation file and compiling
source code for my CppCon2017 talk.

## Description

Learn new ways to think about class design,
that you can apply to your own projects! 

In this talk we'll start with a simple class that models an HTTP
message. We’ll go over the limitations of the simple declaration,
then walk through a series of guided improvements. We will explore
ways to think about class models, create a concept as a customization
point, perform type checking, and document a concept. 

The example class we will explore is based on the message container
found in the Boost.Beast library. You do not need to know anything
(or care) about network protocols. This is about building better classes.
